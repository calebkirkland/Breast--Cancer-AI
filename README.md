Goal: We want to use the sklearn SVM and Clustering modules to do classification on a breast cancer data set. These breast leasions can be classified as either malignant or benign. We need to predict the diagnosis of each sample and then report the accuracy of our prediction using the SVM. And then run the clustering algorthims over the data and plotting the clusters using Matplotlib.
